		<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
		<p>
			In this technology infused age, the dewey decimal system, 
			commonly found in brick and mortar libraries and bookshops, 
			is becoming increasingly less used and known.
		</p>
		<p>
			The technology age of smartphones, tablets, laptops, 
			and desktops need better ways of finding and 
			categorizing/sorting books.
		</p>
		<p>
			LibML is the solution to our book sorting and categorizing
			problem. LibML provides the most effective and efficient way 
			to both sort and find books online. All information is clearly
			shown, thereâ€™s no drawers to pull down, no dewey decimal system 
			to know. LibML can be used to essentially create a log of every
			book ever written through author, title, ISBN, and more.
		</p>
		<h3>Element Structure</h3>
		<p>
			Books contain three major details:
			<ol>
				<li>ISBN</li>
				<li>Detail</li>
				<li>Writers</li>
			</ol>
			These three, in order from most specific down to still specific
			but somewhat general play key factors in organizing books. As 
			for more detail, ISBN cannot be broken down. Detail can be broken
			down into name+, volume?, edition, publishing date, and
			publishing house. Lastly, Writers can be broken into author+ 
			and editor?.
		</p>
		<h3>Attributes</h3>
		<p>
			Some attributes that can added on to certain elements are as
			follows:
			<ul>
				<li>The edition element has the attribute which
					corresponds to what medium the books is printed on. 
					The type may be Softcover, Hardcover, and eBook.</li>
				<li>The isbn element has the attribute of type which may
					contain either 10 or 13.</li>
			</ul>
			These books are listed as their own entity and not per actual
			copy, since this is for reference, not sale, of books. Thus, the
			attribute of condition does not apply.
